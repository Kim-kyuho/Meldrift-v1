# KyuBoard Lite

KyuBoard Lite is a single-board workspace for rich-text memos, local images, Mermaid diagrams, tables, and freehand drawings.

## Lite edition

- Opens the board directly at `/`; there is no board list or authentication.
- Runs a real SQLite database with SQLite WASM and persists its file bytes in browser IndexedDB.
- Runs SQLite in a Web Worker, so editing does not block the UI.
- Compresses local JPEG, PNG, and WebP files in the browser and stores the image bytes inside SQLite.
- Exports and imports portable, real SQLite database files from the board menu.
- Resets the board only after confirmation by deleting the KyuBoard Lite IndexedDB database, without clearing unrelated browser storage.
- Disables Export while a card, a drawing, or an assistant proposal is unfinished.
- Includes an optional AI assistant, protected by its own password because there is no sign-in.
- Does not require a database server, writable Vercel filesystem, or Docker. Only the assistant needs environment variables.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20 or newer and a current browser with WebAssembly, Web Workers, and IndexedDB.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The browser creates its private SQLite database on first use.

## Browser storage

Data belongs to the current browser profile and site origin. It is not synchronized across devices or between localhost and a deployed domain. Reset deletes only KyuBoard Lite's `kyuboard-lite` IndexedDB database after confirmation; it does not clear unrelated databases, caches, local storage, or cookies. Clearing all site data also removes the working SQLite file, so Export should be used for backups and transfers.

Private browsing modes or browser storage policies may prevent persistent storage.

## AI assistant

The assistant turns a request into memo, table, and Mermaid cards, and can also rearrange, edit, or delete the cards already on the board. Nothing reaches the SQLite file until Save to board is pressed; Discard restores the board exactly as it was.

It is off unless two server environment variables are set. Both stay on the server and are never sent to the browser.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_API_KEY` | yes | Google Gemini API key |
| `AI_PASSWORD` | yes | Password that unlocks the assistant |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | no | Pins the chat model; the built-in list stays as fallback |

Because KyuBoard Lite has no sign-in, the assistant asks for `AI_PASSWORD` before it opens. The check happens on the server, which then sets an `HttpOnly` session cookie, so the password is typed once and not again until the browser closes. Every assistant request re-verifies that cookie — the API cost belongs to whoever owns the key, so a client-side flag would not be enough. Repeated wrong guesses are rate limited, and changing `AI_PASSWORD` invalidates every cookie already issued.

The assistant does not generate images. Image cards are reserved for files the user selects locally, keeping image generation cost and storage growth explicit.

For local development, copy the example file and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

## Deploy to Vercel

Use the Next.js framework preset and the repository root as the Root Directory. No database or storage environment variable is needed; add `AI_API_KEY` and `AI_PASSWORD` in the project settings only if you want the assistant.

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```
